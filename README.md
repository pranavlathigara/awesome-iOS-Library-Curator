# iOS_Library_Curator
A review of each project I "Star" On Github. 

As you can tell from my profile, I "STAR" more projects than prety much anyone else. This document is an attempt to break down ech and every one of these! Feel free to contribute! Note: I primarily use Obj-C and this list clearly reflects that. I will make a seperate list for Swift projects

#### First, the gold standard libraries. The essentials --- You **NEED** to know about these !! You're likely to include each of these in most of them

- **AFNetworking**: Probably the most "starred" iOS project on Github, and for good reason. AFNetworking wraps most of the complicated NSURLSession / HTTP / Core Data into one easy to use library.
- **ReactiveCocoa**: If you haven't heard about this one, well, you're in for a serious treat. This lib makes your iOS code _Functional_ and _Reactive_.
- **Mantle**: A great lib for creating Model objects in iOS. Normally, this requires a ton of boilerplate code. Now, it doesn't have to!
- **RESTKit**: A fantastic library for making REST type requests in iOS with WEB services relatively painless.
- **Masonry**: You got autolayout issue? Don't like using storyboards? Use this instead!
- **Objection**: Dependency Injection in objective-c made sooo much easier with this. A great great lib
- **Specta**: A light-weight TDD / BDD framework for Objective-C & Cocoa. This makes testing your code a piece of cake
- **Expecta**: A matcher framework that works fantastically with Specta. expect(**expecta**).to.beAwesome() for testing your ReactiveCocoa code

#### Next up is a personal list of my favorites (essentials don't count here)
- **PromiseKit**

#### Next, we'll start categorizing libraries by function
