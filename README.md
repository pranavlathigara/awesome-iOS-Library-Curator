# iOS_Library_Curator
A review of each project I "Star" On Github. 

As you can tell from my profile, I "STAR" more projects than prety much anyone else. This document is an attempt to break down ech and every one of these! Feel free to contribute! 

## **iOS List**

Here's how this list is going to be categorized:
- Essential Projects
- Networking Frameworks
- UIKit Frameworks

#### First, the gold standard libraries. The essentials --- You **NEED** to know about these !
#### These libraries should be on everybody's short list for iOS projects as you're likely to include these in most of them

- AFNetworking
- ReactiveCocoa
- Mantle
- Masonry
- Objection
- Specta
- Expecta

#### Next, we'll start categorizing libraries by function
