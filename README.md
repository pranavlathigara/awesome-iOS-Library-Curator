# iOS_Library_Curator
A review of each project I "Star" On Github. 

As you can tell from my profile, I "STAR" more projects than prety much anyone else. This document is an attempt to break down ech and every one of these! Feel free to contribute! 

## **iOS List**

Here's how this list is going to be categorized:
1. Essential Projects
2. Frameworks
3. 
4. 
5. 
6. 
7. 
8. 
9. 
10.

#### These libraries should be on everybody's short list for iOS projects as you're likely to include these in most of them
